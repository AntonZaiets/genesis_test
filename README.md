# Description of extra tasks done

## Bulk Delete Functionality:
Added the ability to select multiple tracks or all tracks at once and delete them in a single action. This improves user experience by making mass deletion more efficient.

## Optimistic UI Updates:
Implemented optimistic updates to immediately reflect changes in the user interface (such as deletions) before receiving confirmation from the server. This ensures a faster and smoother experience for users by reducing perceived wait times.
